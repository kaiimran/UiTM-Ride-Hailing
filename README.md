# UiTM-Ride-Hailing

### 4th Semester Project: ITS332

This is my first ever web application. It's really bad, all inputs for queries are not sanitized, password is saved as plain text in MySQL, incorrect use of PHP Sessions and very messy code. I never know anything about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and PHP before building this. Learnt all of that through w3schools in a few days before the submission date. #YOLO

**Description**: Read the .pdf to understand Software Requirement Specifications. Ride-Hailing (like Uber/Grab) for UiTM Segamat students who are always looking for drivers to go to One Segamat Shopping Mall / Bandar Segamat.

**How to use**: Import the "uitmgrab.sql" file to your MySQL database first. Login using the student_matrix and student_pass in database.
